<pre align="center"><font face="Arial">Yes, family is important but friends too. Friends share the same interessts, hobbies and so on. Ok, I tell my family my problems, but there are some topics I donÂ´t want to talk 
about with them. Maybe about boys and parties. A good friend is so important like a family. With my best friend I can hang out, we have the same humor, we can act absolutely crazy,
having fun, and so on. I have amazing friends, there always with my up and down. They also can be a motivator to me beacuse for me, friends are more understanding rather than family. 
For me, how long the acquaintance of the relationship is not important to make somebody as a loyal friends, but looked which friends are always with you when you have a 
problem or together with you when are nothing until you be a "somebody". </font></pre>

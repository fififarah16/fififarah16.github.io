<pre align="center"><font face="Arial">I believe that the word "family" has a very powerful meaning. When I think about my family, I get the feeling of security. I have someone who cares for me, I can count on them, I can
feel that I´m important for them. My family is very important for me because I know they will never let me down, they will always be there when I need them. However, family isn´t just
security and giving love, it also means to show respect for each other and responsibility. In my opinion "family" is a word we use for people we love.</font></pre>
